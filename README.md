# WorldCup_DB

This is one of the required projects to earn my [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-world-cup-database-project/build-a-world-cup-database) 
Relational Database Certification. 
For this project, I had to build a database creating a Bash script that uses SQL to enter information about  World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then query the database for useful statistics.
